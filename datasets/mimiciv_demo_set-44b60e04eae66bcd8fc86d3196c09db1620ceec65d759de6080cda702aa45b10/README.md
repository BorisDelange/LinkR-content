The <a href="https://mimic.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIMIC</a> database, or Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, is a North American database containing data from over <strong>50,000 patients</strong> admitted to intensive care units. It is one of the most widely used critical care databases due to its free access.

Despite its imperfect data quality, it provides a solid foundation for <strong>learning to handle</strong> data from <strong>health data warehouses</strong> (HDW).

The database exists in several versions, with the most recent being MIMIC-IV.

### Test Data (Public Access)

The MIMIC database includes <strong>test datasets</strong> for versions III and IV, containing anonymized data from 100 patients, which are publicly accessible.

You can download the data here:
