### <i class="fa fa-rocket" style="color: steelblue;"></i> First Use

If this is your **first time** using LinkR, go to the *Setup* tab on the left of the screen, and then to the *Tutorials* tab.

There you will learn how the application is **structured**, and how to **use** it.

If you are a **clinician**, first read the section *Your First Study* in the *Setup* tab.

If you are a **data scientist**, you might also want to read the tutorials *Importing Data* and *Creating a Plugin* in the *Tutorials* tab.

### <i class="fa fa-code-branch" style="color: steelblue;"></i> Contributions

LinkR **needs you** to evolve! You can contribute by creating plugins, or by helping to improve the application's code.
